Proof of concept for various approaches to data persistence in relational databases for Scala applications.  Trials Slick (1.0), MapperDAO, and Hibernate.

Partly ported to Slick 3.0 but required changes appear to be incompatible with maintaining three ORM approaches concurrently.  Future application devcelopment will be performed using Slick (3.0) so this repository is left here for reference only.
